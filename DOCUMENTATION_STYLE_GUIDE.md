# ThreatForge Documentation Style Guide

## Overview

This style guide ensures consistency across all ThreatForge documentation, creating a cohesive and professional knowledge base that effectively communicates our component-based emergent behavior architecture.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity First
- Write for the intended audience (developers, users, contributors)
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Explain complex concepts with analogies

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- Start with simple concepts, build complexity gradually
- Use tiered examples (basic → intermediate → advanced → expert)
- Provide clear navigation between difficulty levels

### 3. Practical Focus
- Emphasize practical implementation over theory
- Include working code examples
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Highlight common patterns and anti-patterns

### 4. Consistent Terminology
- Use standardized terms across all documents
- Maintain a glossary of key terms
- Cross-reference related concepts
- Avoid ambiguous language

## Code Example Standards

### Progressive Example Structure
```typescript
// Tier 1: Hello World (Absolute beginner)
// One-liner that demonstrates the core concept
const threat = engine.createThreat('BASIC_INFECTION');

// Tier 2: Basic Composition (Some experience)
// Simple composition with 2-3 components
const threat = engine.compose([
  { type: 'PROPAGATION', properties: { rate: 0.8 } },
  { type: 'INFECTION', properties: { severity: 0.6 } }
]);

// Tier 3: Advanced Composition (Experienced)
// Complex composition with interactions
const threat = new ThreatComposer()
  .addComponent('QUANTUM_ENTANGLEMENT', { coherence: 0.9 })
  .addComponent('BIOLOGICAL_INFECTION', { mutationRate: 0.01 })
  .withInteraction('QUANTUM_BIO_SYNERGY')
  .compose();

// Tier 4: Expert Level (Library developers)
// Custom implementation with full control
class CustomQuantumBioComponent extends ThreatComponent {
  // Complete implementation
}
```

### Code Example Requirements
1. **Complete and Runnable**: Every example must be executable
2. **Context Provided**: Include necessary imports and setup
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Build from simple to complex
4. **Realistic Values**: Use sensible, realistic parameters
5. **Expected Output**: Show what the code produces
6. **Error Handling**: Include basic error handling examples

### Code Formatting
```typescript
// Use consistent formatting
interface ThreatComponent {
  id: string;
  type: ComponentType;
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  behaviors: Behavior[];
  emergencePotential: number;
  domain: ThreatDomain;
}

// Add comments for complex logic
function calculateEmergence(components: ThreatComponent[]): number {
  // Base emergence from component interactions
  const baseEmergence = components.reduce((sum, comp) => 
    sum + comp.emergencePotential, 0) / components.length;
  
  // Cross-domain synergy multiplier
  const domainBonus = getDomainSynergyBonus(components);
  
  return Math.min(1.0, baseEmergence * domainBonus);
}
```

## Terminology Standards

### Core Terms (Always use these exact terms)
- **Component**: Atomic behavioral unit (not "module", "plugin", or "element")
- **Threat**: Composed entity made of components (not "enemy", "agent", or "entity")
- **Emergent Behavior**: Unexpected outcome from component interactions (not "side effect" or "consequence")
- **Cross-Domain**: Interactions between different threat domains (not "multi-domain" or "inter-domain")
- **Composition**: Process of combining components (not "assembly" or "construction")
- **Interaction Matrix**: System defining component relationships (not "compatibility table")

### Domain-Specific Terms
- **Cyber Domain**: Digital threats and network-based attacks
- **Biological Domain**: Pathogens, diseases, and bio-threats
- **Environmental Domain**: Climate, natural disasters, ecological threats
- **Quantum Domain**: Quantum computing and cryptography threats
- **Radiological Domain**: Nuclear and radioactive material threats
- **Robotic Domain**: Autonomous systems and AI threats

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice and Tone
- **Active Voice**: Use active voice whenever possible
  - ✅ "The component creates emergent behaviors"
  - ❌ "Emergent behaviors are created by the component"

- **Professional but Accessible**: Maintain technical accuracy while being readable
  - ✅ "Components interact through a sophisticated matrix system"
  - ❌ "Components do stuff with each other using fancy math"

- **Consistent Perspective**: Use "you" for instructions, "we" for explanations
  - ✅ "You can create threats by composing components"
  - ✅ "We recommend using the composition pattern"

### Sentence Structure
- **Short and Direct**: Aim for 15-20 words per sentence
- **One Concept per Sentence**: Avoid complex compound sentences
- **Parallel Structure**: Use consistent grammatical patterns
- **Transition Words**: Use connecting words for flow

### Paragraph Structure
- **Topic Sentence**: Start with the main idea
- **Supporting Details**: 2-3 sentences explaining the concept
- **Example or Application**: Concrete illustration
- **Transition**: Link to next paragraph or concept

## Visual Standards

### Code Blocks
```typescript
// Always specify language for syntax highlighting
// Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
// Add line comments for complex logic
// Include expected output when relevant
```

### Lists and Tables
- **Use bullet points** for unordered information
- **Use numbered lists** for sequential steps
- **Create tables** for comparative information
- **Add captions** to tables for accessibility

### Links and Cross-References
```markdown
<!-- Internal links -->
See [Component Architecture](./COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

<!-- External links -->

<!-- Cross-references -->

```

## Accessibility Standards

### Language Accessibility
- **Define Technical Terms**: Explain jargon on first use
- **Use Simple Language**: Avoid unnecessarily complex vocabulary
- **Provide Context**: Explain why something is important
- **Include Examples**: Concrete illustrations aid understanding

### Visual Accessibility
- **Alt Text for Images**: Describe diagrams and screenshots
- **Color Considerations**: Don't rely solely on color for meaning
- **Font Choices**: Use readable fonts and sizes
- **Contrast Ratios**: Ensure sufficient contrast for readability
