# ThreatForge Development Plan

## Executive Summary

ThreatForge is an entertaining educational simulation game designed for the browser. It leverages a component-based architecture to model complex, emergent phenomena in a fully destructible, unified 3D world. Players will interact with a rich ecosystem of "threats" (weapons) and "threatenables" (assets), where the composition of granular components leads to unpredictable and educational gameplay. The technical target is a performant, offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) utilizing JavaScript and WebGL for broad accessibility.

## Core Philosophy: Emergent Gameplay by Decomposition

The central design principle is the decomposition of complex phenomena into simple, granular components. By combining these fundamental building blocks, the simulation enables **emergent gameplay**. The interaction between simple, predictable components creates complex, unpredictable, and realistic system-level behaviors that are discovered by the player, not pre-scripted by the developer.

## Technical Architecture

*   **Language:** JavaScript (ES2020+)
*   **Environment:** Browser
*   **Rendering:** WebGL 2.0 (via Three.js)
*   **Architecture:** Offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA)
*   **World Engine:** Unified, seamless 3D planet rendered using a voxel engine for a fully destructible and modifiable environment.
*   **Contextual UI:** Primary user interface is the world itself; direct interaction with objects in 3D space.
