# ThreatForge 3D Engine Development Plan

## Project Overview

ThreatForge is a cutting-edge, comprehensive, and modular game engine designed to simulate modern global threats through **component-based emergent behaviors**. The engine supports detailed simulation across multiple threat domains (cyber, biological, environmental, quantum, radiological, robotic) with a unified 3D rendering system that provides contextual visualization and interaction capabilities, focusing on **atomic component composition** that creates unpredictable, emergent outcomes.

## Core Architecture Goals

- **Component-Based Threat Architecture**: Atomic behavioral components that compose into complex emergent threats
- **Cross-Domain Interaction Matrix**: Sophisticated system calculating component interactions across domains
- **Emergent Behavior Engine**: AI-driven system predicting unexpected outcomes from component interactions
- **Offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA)** with WebGL rendering
- **Unified 3D engine** for map rendering and contextual model visualization
- **Development mode** with component inspection and manipulation tools
- **Asymmetric faction system** with unique capabilities and objectives

## Component Development Principles

1. **Atomic Design**: Components should be minimal, focused behavioral units
2. **Emergent Focus**: Design for unexpected interactions, not predetermined outcomes
3. **Cross-Domain Compatibility**: Components should interact naturally across domains
4. **Educational Value**: Each component should teach real-world principles
5. **Performance Conscious**: Components must scale to thousands of instances
6. **Extensible Architecture**: New components should integrate seamlessly

This component-based approach transforms ThreatForge from a traditional threat simulation into a dynamic ecosystem where complex, emergent behaviors arise naturally from atomic component interactions, providing both educational value and engaging gameplay through unpredictable emergent outcomes.
