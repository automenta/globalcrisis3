}
```

## Narrative Engine

### Dynamic Story Generation

The AI-driven Narrative Engine creates emergent storylines by chaining events into complex chronicles that respond to player actions and simulation outcomes.

#### Event Chaining System

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant T as Threat A
  participant W as World State
  participant P as Population
  participant F as Faction
  participant N as Narrative Engine

  T->>W: Triggers economic collapse
  W->>P: Unemployment rises 30%
  P->>F: Support drops for ruling faction
  F->>N: Deploys counter-threat
  N->>W: Records "Economic Uprising" event chain
```

#### Chronicle Generation

- **Input**: Event chains with 3+ causally linked events
- **Process**: 
  1. Classify event types and themes
  2. Determine narrative archetype (Betrayal, Revolution, Redemption, Escalation)
  3. Generate evocative titles incorporating threat domains
  4. Create detailed narrative summaries

```typescript
interface NarrativeChain {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  timeline: string[];
  primaryFactions: FactionType[];
  globalImpact: number;
  keyOutcomes: string[];
  domainsInvolved: ThreatDomain[];
  turningPoint: string;
  resolution: 'POSITIVE' | 'NEGATIVE' | 'NEUTRAL';
  duration: number;
  quantumEntanglement?: number;
  radContamination?: number;
  roboticAutonomy?: number;
}
```

#### Event Weighting System

Events are dynamically weighted based on severity, cross-domain impacts, and domain-specific properties:

```typescript
function calculateEventWeight(event: Event): number {
  let weight = (event.severity * 0.6) +
               (event.crossDomainImpacts.length * 0.3) +
               (event.factionsInvolved.length * 0.1);

  // Domain-specific modifiers
  if (event.domainsInvolved.includes("QUANTUM") && event.quantumCoherence) {
    weight *= 1 + (event.quantumCoherence * 0.3);
  }
  if (event.domainsInvolved.includes("RAD") && event.radHalfLife) {
    weight *= 1 + (1 - Math.exp(-0.01 * event.radHalfLife));
  }
  if (event.domainsInvolved.includes("ROBOT") && event.roboticAutonomy) {
    weight *= 1 + (event.roboticAutonomy * 0.4);
  }

  return Math.min(2.0, weight);
}
```

### Emergent Behavior System

The unified systems framework enables complex emergent behaviors through component interactions:

```typescript
function calculateCrossImpact(threatA: Threat, threatB: Threat): number {
  const baseEffect = threatA.severity * threatB.severity;
  const domainMultiplier = DOMAIN_MATRIX[threatA.domain][threatB.domain];
  const synergy = threatA.crossDomainImpacts
    .find(i => i.domain === threatB.domain)?.multiplier || 1.0;
  const regionModifier = calculateRegionModifier(threatA.region, threatB.region);
  const timeFactor = Math.exp(-0.1 * Math.abs(threatA.age - threatB.age));
  
  return baseEffect * domainMultiplier * synergy * regionModifier * timeFactor;
}
```

This unified systems documentation provides comprehensive coverage of all ThreatForge systems while maintaining focus on emergent behaviors and cross-domain interactions that create complex, unpredictable gameplay scenarios.
