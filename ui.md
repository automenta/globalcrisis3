# Player Interface Enhancements

This document outlines the key enhancements to the player interface in ThreatForge, focusing on an adaptive UI system, an augmented reality mode, and comprehensive accessibility features. These improvements aim to provide an intuitive, immersive, and inclusive user experience.

## Neurological Impact Visualization

- **Cognitive Heatmaps**:
    - Displays regions by psychological trauma level
    - Overlay options:
        - Trust degradation
        - Compliance shifts
    - 3D neuro-signature waveforms

## AR Threat Projection

- **Quantum State Viewer**:
    - Visualize superposition of threat outcomes
    - Gesture-based waveform collapse interaction
    - Holographic display of entangled systems

## Adaptive UI System

The Adaptive UI System in ThreatForge dynamically adjusts the user interface based on the current game state, player actions, and emerging threats. This ensures that players always have the most relevant information and controls at their fingertips, reducing cognitive load and improving decision-making.

- **Context-Sensitive Controls**: The interface automatically changes and highlights relevant controls or information based on the player's current situation, selected unit, or active threat. For example, when a biological threat is active, biological countermeasures become more prominent.
- **Threat Prioritization**: Implements a dynamic ranking and alert system for threats, ensuring that the most critical and immediate dangers are highlighted. This helps players focus their attention and resources effectively.
- **Decision Support**: Provides AI-assisted recommendations and predictive analytics, offering players insights into potential outcomes of their decisions, complete with risk analysis and probability assessments.
- **Historical Comparison**: Allows players to view and compare current scenarios with past similar events, providing historical context and enabling learning from previous successes or failures.
- **Multi-Faction View**: Offers the ability to simultaneously view the perspectives and intelligence of multiple factions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the global situation and enabling more informed strategic decisions.

## Augmented Reality Mode

The Augmented Reality (AR) Mode in ThreatForge offers an immersive and interactive way to experience the simulation by overlaying game data onto the real world. This feature is designed for devices supporting AR capabilities, providing a unique perspective on global threats.

- **Geospatial Visualization**: Overlays real-world map data with in-game elements, allowing players to visualize threat propagation, unit movements, and faction control directly on a geographical map of their surroundings.
- **Threat Projections**: Renders dynamic AR threat simulations, showing how threats might spread or impact specific real-world locations, providing a tangible sense of scale and urgency.
- **Unit Control**: Enables AR-based unit deployment and command, allowing players to interact with their forces and issue orders by physically pointing or gesturing in their environment.
- **Data Layering**: Provides the ability to toggle between different information layers in the AR view, such as economic impact, population density, or environmental vulnerabilities, offering customizable data visualization.
- **Collaborative Mode**: Supports a shared AR workspace for team strategy, allowing multiple players in the same physical location to interact with the same AR simulation, facilitating collaborative planning and decision-making.

## Accessibility Features

ThreatForge is committed to providing an inclusive gaming experience for all players. A comprehensive suite of accessibility features ensures that the game is enjoyable and navigable regardless of individual needs or preferences.

- **Color Mode Switching**: Offers more than six distinct color schemes, including various color-blind friendly options and high-contrast modes, allowing players to customize the visual presentation to their comfort.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provides full narration of all in-game text, events, and UI elements, making the game accessible to visually impaired players or those who prefer auditory information.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enables complete control of the game using only the keyboard, ensuring that players who cannot use a mouse or prefer keyboard input can fully navigate and interact with the interface.
- **Customizable Controls**: Allows players to remap all keyboard and mouse inputs, providing full flexibility to configure controls in a way that is most comfortable and efficient for them.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Offers adjustable challenge levels that modify the game's difficulty without altering core mechanics or narrative elements. This ensures that players of all skill levels can enjoy the strategic depth of ThreatForge at their own pace.
