# ThreatForge üöÄ

## Overview

ThreatForge is a cutting-edge game engine that simulates modern global threats through **component-based emergent behaviors**. Instead of pre-defined threats, you compose complex scenarios from atomic behavioral components that interact to create unpredictable, realistic outcomes with **dynamically adjustable performance** to run on everything from mobile devices to high-end gaming systems.

### What Makes ThreatForge Unique

Traditional threat simulations use rigid, pre-defined threats. ThreatForge revolutionizes this approach by implementing a **component-based architecture** where complex threats **emerge naturally** from simple, atomic components interacting across multiple domains, with **adaptive performance** that scales to your hardware.

## üéØ Quick Start (2 Minutes)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/threatforge/engine.git
cd engine
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

```typescript
// Your first emergent threat with adaptive performance
import { GameEngine } from '@threatforge/core'

const engine = new GameEngine({
  performance: {
    quality: 'adaptive',  // Auto-adjusts to your hardware
    targetFPS: 60,
    detailLevel: 'auto'
  }
})

const pandemic = engine.composeThreat([
  { type: 'AIRBORNE_TRANSMISSION', properties: { range: 1000 } },
  { type: 'MUTATION_ENGINE', properties: { rate: 0.001 } }
])

console.log(`Created threat with ${pandemic.emergentBehaviors.length} emergent behaviors`)
console.log(`Running at ${pandemic.performanceMetrics.currentFPS} FPS`)
```

## üß© Core Concepts

### Component-Based Architecture

Threats are **composed** from atomic behavioral components, not hardcoded:

```typescript
// Traditional approach (rigid, limited)
const covid = new PredefinedThreat('COVID_VARIANT')

// ThreatForge approach (flexible, emergent, performance-aware)
const covid = new ThreatComposer({
  performance: {
    quality: 'balanced',
    maxEmergentBehaviors: 50
  }
})
  .addComponent('AIRBORNE_TRANSMISSION', { range: 1000 })
  .addComponent('MUTATION_ENGINE', { rate: 0.001 })
  .addComponent('SEASONAL_VARIATION', { amplitude: 0.3 })
  .compose() // Emergent behaviors discovered automatically
```

### Cross-Domain Interactions

Components from different domains create **unexpected synergies**:

- **Cyber + Biological**: AI-generated pathogens with network propagation
- **Quantum + Information**: Quantum-entangled disinformation campaigns
- **Environmental + Robotic**: Climate-triggered autonomous system failures
- **Radiological + Cognitive**: Radiation-induced behavioral modification

### Emergent Complexity

Simple components combine to create **unpredictable outcomes**:

```typescript
// Individual components are simple...
const quantum = { coherence: 0.8, range: 500 }
const bio = { transmission: 0.6, mutation: 0.01 }

// ...but their interactions create complex behaviors
const hybrid = compose(quantum, bio, {
  performance: 'adaptive',
  complexity: 'high'
})
// Results in: Quantum-accelerated viral evolution
//            Predictive variant generation
//            Coherence-dependent infectivity
//            Performance automatically optimized
```
