# Multiplayer Enhancements

This document details the multiplayer features and systems within ThreatForge, designed to provide engaging and dynamic interactions between players. It covers matchmaking, competitive and cooperative play modes, and the underlying event system that drives multiplayer scenarios.

## Matchmaking System

The ThreatForge matchmaking system is designed to create fair and balanced multiplayer experiences, connecting players based on skill, preferred roles, and network conditions. It incorporates advanced algorithms to ensure competitive integrity and enjoyable cooperative play.

- **Skill-Based Matching**: Utilizes an ELO rating system to accurately assess player skill and match individuals or teams of similar proficiency, ensuring competitive fairness.
- **Role Specialization**: Facilitates the formation of balanced teams in cooperative matches by considering players' preferred faction roles, promoting synergistic gameplay.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Integrates AI adjustment mechanisms that adapt the game's challenge level based on the collective skill of the players, ensuring an engaging experience for all.
- **Cross-Progression**: Supports cloud-saved progress, allowing players to seamlessly continue their multiplayer campaigns and retain their achievements across multiple devices.
- **Quantum-Secure Networking**: Implements end-to-end encryption for all network communications using quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, ensuring highly secure and private multiplayer sessions.
- **Latency Compensation**: Employs physics-aware netcode to minimize the impact of network latency, providing a smooth and responsive real-time interaction experience for all players, regardless of their connection quality.

## Competitive Play

Competitive multiplayer in ThreatForge offers diverse scenarios where factions vie for dominance through strategic planning, resource management, and direct confrontation. The asymmetric nature of factions ensures varied gameplay and encourages unique strategies.

- **Asymmetric Objectives**: Opposing factions are assigned distinct win conditions, promoting diverse strategies and counter-strategies rather than simple head-to-head combat.
- **Resource Wars**: Players compete to control key regions rich in resources, which provide strategic advantages and are crucial for funding operations and developing advanced technologies.
- **Espionage Mode**: A dedicated mode focused on intelligence gathering, counter-intelligence, and covert operations, allowing players to steal vital information or sabotage enemy efforts.
- **Alliance Politics**: Features a dynamic diplomatic system where players can form alliances, negotiate treaties, or engage in betrayals, adding a layer of political intrigue to the gameplay.
- **Quantum Computing Races**: Factions race to achieve quantum supremacy, investing in research and development to unlock powerful quantum capabilities that can disrupt global systems.
- **Robotic Warfare Arenas**: Dedicated Player-vs-Player (PvP) zones where players can deploy and command autonomous robotic systems in tactical combat scenarios, testing their robotic engineering and command skills.

## Cooperative Play

Cooperative multiplayer in ThreatForge emphasizes teamwork and coordinated efforts to overcome global challenges. Players must combine their faction's unique strengths to mitigate threats and achieve shared objectives.

- **Shared Objectives**: Teams work together towards common goals, such as containing a global pandemic, neutralizing a widespread cyber attack, or stabilizing the world economy.
- **Specialized Roles**: Each faction possesses complementary abilities, requiring players to specialize in their roles (e.g., Technocrats focusing on tech solutions, Mitigators on containment) and coordinate effectively.
- **Distributed Threats**: Threats are often geographically separated or require multi-domain responses, necessitating teamwork and strategic deployment across the global map.
- **Collective Narratives**: Cooperative games feature shared story arcs that evolve based on collective player actions and decisions, leading to branching outcomes and a sense of shared history.
- **Cross-Domain Synergy**: Players are encouraged to combine their faction abilities to create amplified effects, such as a Bio-Cyber synergy to rapidly develop and deploy a vaccine against a digitally spread pathogen.
- **Quantum Entanglement Coordination**: Advanced cooperative scenarios may involve shared quantum states for real-time coordination, allowing for instantaneous communication and synchronized actions across vast distances, representing a cutting-edge form of collaborative play.

## Multiplayer Event System

The Multiplayer Event System is a core component that drives dynamic and interactive scenarios in both competitive and cooperative play. These events are triggered based on game state, player actions, or narrative progression, presenting players with challenges and opportunities that require strategic responses.

```typescript
interface MultiplayerEvent {
    id: string; // Unique identifier for the event.
    type: 'THREAT' | 'DIPLOMACY' | 'DISASTER' | 'TECH_BREAKTHROUGH'; // The category of the event.
    participants: string[]; // An array of player IDs involved in or affected by the event.
    requiredRoles: FactionType[]; // The faction types that are specifically required or best suited to address this event.
    timeLimit: number; // Turns to complete, the maximum number of game turns allowed to resolve the event.
    successConditions: {
        // Criteria that must be met for the event to be considered successful.
        threshold: number; // The target value for the specified metrics.
        metrics: ('DAMAGE' | 'CONTROL' | 'KNOWLEDGE')[]; // The metrics (e.g., damage reduction, control gain, knowledge acquisition) used to evaluate success.
    };
    rewards: {
        // Benefits granted upon successful completion of the event.
        factionResources: Record<FactionType, ResourcePool>; // Resources (e.g., intel, tech, manpower) awarded to specific factions.
        unlockables: string[]; // New technologies, units, or abilities unlocked by completing the event.
    };
}

// Quantum-entangled multiplayer events
interface QuantumLinkedEvent extends MultiplayerEvent {
    entanglementLevel: number;
    requiredSynchronization: number; // 0-1
}

function createQuantumEvent(players: Player[]): QuantumLinkedEvent {
    return {
        id: `quantum-event-${Date.now()}`,
        type: 'TECH_BREAKTHROUGH',
        participants: players.map((p) => p.id),
        requiredRoles: players.map((p) => p.factionType),
        timeLimit: 5,
        successConditions: {
            threshold: 0.8,
            metrics: ['SYNCHRONIZATION'],
        },
        rewards: {
            factionResources: {},
            unlockables: ['QUANTUM_COMMUNICATION'],
        },
        entanglementLevel: 0.85,
        requiredSynchronization: 0.7,
    };
}

// Quantum-entangled multiplayer events
// This function generates a special type of MultiplayerEvent that leverages quantum entanglement
// for unique cooperative challenges. These events often involve shared knowledge or synchronized actions
// across multiple players, reflecting the interconnectedness of quantum systems.
function generateEntangledEvent(players: Player[]): MultiplayerEvent {
    const factions = players.map((p) => p.faction);
    return {
        id: `quantum-event-${Date.now()}`,
        type: 'TECH_BREAKTHROUGH',
        participants: players.map((p) => p.id),
        requiredRoles: factions,
        timeLimit: 5,
        successConditions: {
            threshold: 0.8,
            metrics: ['KNOWLEDGE'],
        },
        rewards: {
            factionResources: {
                [FactionType.TECHNOCRAT]: { intel: 500, tech: 300 },
                [FactionType.MITIGATOR]: { intel: 400, manpower: 200 },
                // ... other factions
            },
            unlockables: ['QUANTUM_COMMUNICATION'],
        },
    };
}
```
